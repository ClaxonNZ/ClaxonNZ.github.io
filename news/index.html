							National leader Simon Bridges has struck out at local councillors playing "politics" after Auckland Council voted unanimously to declare a climate emergency.<br><br>

							By declaring an emergency, Auckland council has committed to visibly incorporating climate change considerations into their decisions, as well as advocating for central Government action.<br><br>

							It follows large strikes across the country from young people demanding change and real action to stop global warming.<br><br>
							
							
							
							Councils in Canterbury, Nelson and Kapiti Coast have declared a climate emergency, as well as the Waitakere and Waitemat&amacr; local boards. Last month the United Kingdom declared a climate emergency<br><br>

							But Bridges believes it's all just "politics".

							While he says he supports taking climate change seriously, that doesn't mean calling it a "climate emergency" is necessary.<br><br>

							"I take climate change seriously and that is why we have been working with the Government on what they are doing, but to have a climate emergency, as they are called, it is simply politics," he told The AM Show on Wednesday.<br><br>

							The National Party supported the Government's Zero Carbon Bill - which provides targets on how the Government will address climate change - in its first reading in May. However, the party has disagreed with the proposed agricultural methane target.<br><br>

							Green Party MP Chl&ouml;e Swarbrick attempted to pass a motion in Parliament in May that would have declared a climate emergency. But members of the Opposition opposed it.<br><br>

							
							
							<div class="fig-caption">
								<div class="quote">
								That this House declare a climate emergency, recognising the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
							that global temperatures are projected to continue increasing beyond 2 degrees by 2050, unless action is taken to reduce 
							greenhouse gas emissions; and that this House further recognises the potential disruption to the natural environment, our 
							society and economy from extreme weather events, droughts, and sea level rises; and that consequently this House affirms 
							the need to work with communities, councils, young people, iwi and hapu, farmers, and business to develop plans to transition
							to a low-emissions economy and adapt to the effects of climate change.<br>
								</div><br>
								
								
								<div>Motion by MP Chl&ouml;e Swarbrick. </div>

							Bridges said he had some advice for local councillors contemplating whether announcing a climate emergency in a local election year was the right move.<br><br>
							
							"I don't think it gets anywhere. If you are on a council right now, my respectful advice to you would be to start thinking about the long-term issues, about adaptation 
							and what you do, but to be out there in a shrill way saying 'climate emergency' to get votes, I don't think it's on." <br><br>

							School Strike for Climate Change organiser Luke Wijohn said the declaration is a start but it needs to be followed through.<br><br>

							"I'm really excited about today because declaring an emergency is the first step we can take to have real action on climate change," he told Newshub.<br><br>

							Auckland Council has put aside $40 million for a long term plan for climate change but Mayor Phil Goff said on Tuesday that isn't enough and there needs to be a more detailed plan in place.<br><br>

							"If we defer those costs now, those costs don't get smaller, they get bigger and they get worse. We're putting together a framework, but a framework is nothing until we have an action plan that's fully costed," Goff told the council.<br><br>

							Environment and Community Committee chairperson Penny Hulse said the decision elevated the importance of "an immediate national and global response to address our changing climate".<br><br>

							The Climate Change Stocktake Report for 2017/18 notes that by 2040 New Zealand's air temperature is forecast to increase by 0.7-1C, and 3C higher by 2090.<br><br>

							As a result of warming temperatures, sea levels are projected to rise by 0.3-1 metre by 2100. But the threat of Antarctic sheets collapsing could mean this range substantially increases.<br><br>

							In 2015, New Zealand signed up to the Paris Agreement, agreeing to keep global average temperatures below 2degC and pursuing efforts to limit to 1.5C.<br><br>

							The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we have only roughly 12 years to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reach the Paris Agreement target of 1.5C<br><br>

							<h1 style="line-height:1; text-align:left"> Paul Mountfort: March 15 changed NZ in another way... our children found their voice on climate action   </h1>
							
							
							<a target="_blank" style="float:right;" href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12229654">NZ Herald, 10th May 2019</a><br><br>
							
							 As our nation continues to mourn March 15's loss of life, and Christchurch's bereaved return to their private, permanent griefs, perhaps there is a chance to offer further tribute to their passing. <br><br>
							
							 March 15 was significant for another event which the tragic massacre eclipsed both locally and globally, but which will not go away. This was the first of what will doubtless be many strikes by school students demanding immediate climate action globally.<br><br>

							 Following Greta Thunberg's solitary lead, thousands of our children made their voices heard on our main streets and town squares. In lieu of action by our
							 political and business leaders they would be the "adults in the room" and march to reclaim their future.<br><br>
							 
							 
							 As well they must. A recent scientific meta-study concluded that the chances of the science of anthropocentric global warming (AGW) being incorrect has reached
							 5-Sigma level - or 3 x 10<sup>7</sup>. <br><br>
							 
							 
							 For laymen betting against climate change, the odds are 3.5 million to one. Denialists are effectively like someone whose retirement plan consists of buying a lotto ticket.
							 Are you feeling lucky? <br><br>
							 
							 But it's worse than this because of the moral failing involved. These are our children's and our grandchildren's, our tamariki and our mokopuna's futures we are gambling on. <br><br>
							 
							 If an expert panel of engineers told you that the chances of the plane you were about to pack your kids on to of reaching its destination were millions to one, would you listen
							 to the sole contrarian in the room who assures you that jet engines are too complex to troubleshoot? <br><br>
							 
							 We must stop humouring these denialist cranks. We need instead to heed the stark warnings issued to us and our governments by the world's foremost climate experts. <br><br>
							 
							 For ecological and civilisational crash is what we face under business as usual: "best" estimates of 3-5&deg;C temperature rises this century, likely to unleash such chaos as to
							and the conditions necessary for organised human existence. <br><br>
							
							Even the 2&deg;C target of the Paris Accord threatens horrors we've become absurdly inured to. A death spiral for coral and thus the ocean food chain. Collapse of the glaciation
							systems in the Himalayas that feed the vast populations of India, China and neighbouring countries. The inexorable inundation of coastal cities. Cascading species crashes. 
							Droughts, deserts, superstorms. In short, hell on earth. <br><br>
							
							
							It may see that New Zealand can do little to avert these absolute catastrophes. Strictly speaking this is true. Our contribution to global carbon emissions is miniscule. But the
							capacity for inspiring symbolism is huge. <br><br>
							
							Witness the aftermath of the dreadful tragedy in Christchurch. Without wishing to paper over the fault lines that exist in our nation, the world saw us rise to the occasion
							with compassion, liberality and tolerance. And steely resolve: semi-automatic weapons are now banned where other counties have prevaricated for decades. <br><br>
							
							Jacinda Adern has called climate change our "nuclear-free moment", albeit one that is even more challenging. We call on the PM to continue the leadership for which she has been
							praised globally in progressing the passage of New Zealand's Zero Carbon Act. <br><br>

							National's reticence and New Zealand First voters' susceptibility to climate skepticism are weighing on the prospects for a robust, bipartisan accord. But a version that is watered
							down for political exigency is unacceptable. <br><br>
							
							Agricultural emissions comprise almost half of our national total. Rather that fudging this with concessions for methane, farmers need support to make the transition to low
							carbon agriculture, regardless of the inevitable flatulence of opponents who will doubtless paint this as a return to subsidies. <br><br>
							
							The climate crisis is a national and global emergency and we urge the PM to reflect this in following the lead of the British Parliament in declaring a national and environmental emergency. <br><br>

							We need to urgently invest in smart energy grids and clean intercity rail. Smart cities, smart housing with smart transport networks. Sustainable rather than mass tourism. To plan
							for what is coming. <br><br>
							
							SuperGold Card holders and rural voters may be resistant but they too have children and grandchildren. <br><br>
							
							At this crucial juncture in history New Zealand can indeed be first. We recently experience what it is to once again lead the world in out nation's response to adversity.
							Now is not the time to lose our nerve but to stand up and be counted on this, most crucial of all issues. <br><br>
							
							New Zealand needs a Zero Carbon Act worthy of the name. We need to lead the world by example. To do ourselves whatever is necessary globally to cap warming at 1.5&deg;C rise, at
							absolute most. To make our children and grandchildren proud. <br><br>
							
							
							Along with some pain this will bring many benefits and better, more sustainable ways of living. No less, the knowledge that we are stepping up and doing our bit.<br><br>
							
							Our children are watching. Their future deserves nothing less.<br><br>
