							<h1> About Claxon </h1>
							
							<div class="caption-div" style="text-align:center; line-height:1.5em">
							
							Claxon’s first goal is to get as many people as possible to add their name to this website, to urge the New Zealand House of Representatives to declare a Climate Emergency. 
							
						
							We formed Claxon to act on the undeniable scientific evidence of the global climate emergency.  
							Because this emergency affects every human, no matter where they live or how they vote, we coloured Claxon orange, so it is non-partisan, and urgent.  
							Paul Mountfort coined the name Claxon, both as a contraction of "climate-action" and as a reference to the 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_horn">Klaxon warning siren.</a>
