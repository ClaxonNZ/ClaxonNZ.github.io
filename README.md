The scientific consensus is that the world stands on the verge of unprecedented environmental and climate catastrophe for which we are little prepared, and which affords us only a few years for mitigating action. 

We, the undersigned, urge the New Zealand government to follow the lead of the UK Parliament on the 1st of May by tabling a parliamentary motion to declare an environmental and climate change emergency, now.
